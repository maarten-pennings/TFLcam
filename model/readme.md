# Rock, Paper, Scissors model

This page shows how I made the Rock, Paper, Scissors robot.
It consists of two models: the screen fixture and the hand fixture.

The hand fixture can be made from parts in the 51515 Robot Inventor set, 
except that you need two extra 8-tooth gear, either the 
[old](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3647) one or the 
[new](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=10928) one - actually 
there are even [more](https://rebrickable.com/parts/3647/technic-gear-8-tooth/) versions.

For the screen fixture, you need extra parts.

By the way, see a sibling [directory](../mindstorms) in this github project, 
for the code running on the mindstorms programmable brick.

## The screen fixture

The screen fixture model consists of several parts. 
The _screen holder_ will keep the paperboard screen in place.
The screen holder has a _screen holder base_ to keep it upright.
This screen holder base is connected to a long _foundation_,
which holds the _hand rest_ and the _camera holder_.

### Screen holder base

**Step 1.01** We begin with the screen holder base parts ...

![Step1.01](screen/step1.01.jpg)

**Step 1.02** .. assembled.

![Step1.02](screen/step1.02.jpg)

**Step 1.03** This will fix the paperboard at the bottom ...

![Step1.03](screen/step1.03.jpg)

**Step 1.04** ... assembled ...

![Step1.04](screen/step1.04.jpg)

**Step 1.05** ... and attached to the base.

![Step1.05](screen/step1.05.jpg)

**Step 1.06** We make two braces.

![Step1.06](screen/step1.06.jpg)

**Step 1.07** Assemble the left and right side ...

![Step1.07](screen/step1.07.jpg)

**Step 1.08** ... join that together with the braces to the rest of the base ...

![Step1.08](screen/step1.08.jpg)

**Step 1.09** ... and the screen holder base is finished.

![Step1.09](screen/step1.09.jpg)

### Attaching the screen holder

**Step 2.01** We begin with the vertical beams for the screen holder.

![Step2.01](screen/step2.01.jpg)

**Step 2.02** We need two of them, mirrored.

![Step2.02](screen/step2.02.jpg)

**Step 2.03** We also need two horizontal beams for the screen holder.

![Step2.03](screen/step2.03.jpg)

**Step 2.04** We attach the two vertical beams and mount the two horizontal beams.

![Step2.04](screen/step2.04.jpg)

**Step 2.05** This is the sub assembly that will fix the paperboard at the top ...

![Step2.05](screen/step2.05.jpg)

**Step 2.06** ... assembled.

![Step2.06](screen/step2.06.jpg)

**Step 2.07** This is the sub assembly that will fix the paperboard at the side ...

![Step2.07](screen/step2.07.jpg)

**Step 2.08** ... assembled.

![Step2.08](screen/step2.08.jpg)

**Step 2.09** The two sub assemblies are assembled (note all the pins) ...

![Step2.09](screen/step2.09.jpg)

**Step 2.10** .. to the (right) side bar (note the 1 and 2 "gaps" at the bottom) ...

![Step2.10](screen/step2.10.jpg)

**Step 2.11** ... and we need to make a mirrored copy for the left side bar.

![Step2.11](screen/step2.11.jpg)

**Step 2.12** The two side bars are attached to the holder base (note the gaps on both sides).

![Step2.12](screen/step2.12.jpg)

### Attaching the hand rest

**Step 3.01** We begin with 4 L-beams, 6 pins and 2 long pins ...

![Step3.01](screen/step3.01.jpg)

**Step 3.02** ... and assemble that to the hand rest.

![Step3.02](screen/step3.02.jpg)

**Step 3.03** With two 7-long beams ...

![Step3.03](screen/step3.03.jpg)

**Step 3.04** ... connect the hand rest to the holder base.

![Step3.04](screen/step3.04.jpg)


### Attaching the foundation

**Step 4.01** We connect 1 L-beams and 3 long beams with 9 pins.

![Step4.01](screen/step4.01.jpg)

**Step 4.02** Add three braces ...

![Step4.02](screen/step4.02.jpg)

**Step 4.03**  ... to the foundation ...

![Step4.04](screen/step4.04.jpg)

**Step 4.04** ... and an L beam ...

![Step4.04](screen/step4.04.jpg)

**Step 4.05** ... is connected to the other end.

![Step4.05](screen/step4.05.jpg)

**Step 4.06** Three 15 long beams ...

![Step4.06](screen/step4.06.jpg)

**Step 4.07** ... finish off the other side of the foundation.

![Step4.07](screen/step4.07.jpg)


### Attaching the camera holder

**Step 5.01** We create two mirrored brackets ...

![Step5.01](screen/step5.01.jpg)

**Step 5.02** ... for the camera ...

![Step5.02](screen/step5.02.jpg)

**Step 5.03** ... and attach that to the foundation ...

![Step5.03](screen/step5.03.jpg)

**Step 5.04** ... closing off with the last bracket.

![Step5.04](screen/step5.04.jpg)

**Step 5.05** The screen fixture is completed.

![Step5.05](screen/step5.05.jpg)


### Attaching the screen

It is suggested to take a thin piece of paperboard and cut it to the correct dimensions: 18 lego unit high or 144 mm and 27 lego units wide or 216 mm. It is suggested to make the paperboard a couple of mm's wider than 216.

**Step 6.01** Slide in the paperboard. Make sure the long tile at the bottom presses the paperboard against the screen holder.

![Step6.01](screen/step6.01.jpg)

**Step 6.02** The "side wings" should hold the paperboard on the sides: the paperboard should be behind the flange of the round stud. Note that the "side wings" can rotate slightly to press against the paperboard.

![Step6.02](screen/step6.02.jpg)

**Step 6.03** The gray pegs at the top have a slit. The paperboard is supposed to run through those slits. Note that the peg position can be fine tuned in Y and Z direction using the axles.

![Step6.03](screen/step6.03.jpg)

**Step 6.04** This finishes the screen fixture.

![Step6.04](screen/step6.04.jpg)



## The hand fixture

The hand fixture model consists of several parts. 
The hand is formed by the _palm_ and the _fingers_
They rest on the _hand base_ which contains the brick and the _motor assembly_.

![Overview](hand/step0.01.jpg)

### Hand palm

**Step 1.01** We begin with the hand palm ...

![Step1.01](hand/step1.01.jpg)

**Step 1.02** ... using two tiles as spacers ...

![Step1.02](hand/step1.02.jpg)

**Step 1.03** ... the three parts are not yet connected.

![Step1.03](hand/step1.03.jpg)

**Step 1.04** We add the finger holders  ...

![Step1.04](hand/step1.04.jpg)

**Step 1.05** ... and use the axle ...

![Step1.05](hand/step1.05.jpg)

**Step 1.06** ... to hold the palm ...

![Step1.06](hand/step1.06.jpg)

**Step 1.07** ... together.

![Step1.07](hand/step1.07.jpg)

**Step 1.08** We create the pinky holder ...

![Step1.08](hand/step1.08.jpg)

**Step 1.09** ... and place it to the bottom ...

![Step1.09](hand/step1.09.jpg)

**Step 1.10** ... of the palm (still unconnected).

![Step1.10](hand/step1.10.jpg)

**Step 1.11** We reinforce with two axles ...

![Step1.11](hand/step1.11.jpg)

**Step 1.12** ... which completes the palm.

![Step1.12](hand/step1.12.jpg)

### Attaching the fingers

**Step 2.01** We add the index and middle finger ...

![Step2.01](hand/step2.01.jpg)

**Step 2.02** ... to the top of the palm.

![Step2.02](hand/step2.02.jpg)

**Step 2.03** The left-most axle should move the top two fingers.

![Step2.03](hand/step2.03.jpg)

**Step 2.04** We add the ring and little finger (pinky) ...

![Step2.04](hand/step2.04.jpg)

**Step 2.05** to the bottom of the palm.

![Step2.05](hand/step2.05.jpg)

**Step 2.06** The new left-most axle should move the bottom two fingers.

![Step2.06](hand/step2.06.jpg)

**Step 2.07** These are the parts for the sub assembly ...

![Step2.07](hand/step2.07.jpg)

**Step 2.08** ... of the thumb.

![Step2.08](hand/step2.08.jpg)

**Step 2.09** The thumb is attached ...

![Step2.09](hand/step2.09.jpg)

**Step 2.10** ... to the top of the palm.

![Step2.10](hand/step2.10.jpg)
