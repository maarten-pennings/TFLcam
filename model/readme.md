# Rock, Paper, Scissors model

This page shows how I made the Rock, Paper, Scissors robot.
It consists of two models: the screen fixture and the hand.

## The screen fixture

The model consists of several parts. 
The _screen holder_ will keep the paperboard screen in place.
The screen holder has a _screen holder base_ to keep it upright.
This screen holder base is connected to a long _foundation_,
which holds the _hand rest_ and the _camera holder_.

### Screen holder base

**Step 1.01** We begin with the screen holder base parts ...
![Step1.01](screen/step1.01.jpg)

**Step 1.02** .. assembled.
![Step1.02](screen/step1.02.jpg)

**Step 1.03** This will fix the paperboard at the bottom ...

**Step 1.04** ... assembled ...
![Step1.04](screen/step1.04.jpg)

**Step 1.05** ... and attached to the base.

**Step 1.06** We make two braces.
![Step1.06](screen/step1.06.jpg)

**Step 1.07** Assemble the left and right side ...
![Step1.07](screen/step1.07.jpg)

**Step 1.08** ... join that together with the braces to the rest of the base ...
![Step1.08](screen/step1.08.jpg)

**Step 1.09** ... and the screen holder base is finished.

### Attaching the screen holder

**Step 2.01** We begin with the vertical beams for the screen holder.
![Step2.01](screen/step2.01.jpg)

**Step 2.02** We need two of them, mirrored.
![Step2.02](screen/step2.02.jpg)

**Step 2.03** We also need two horizontal beams for the screen holder.
![Step2.03](screen/step2.03.jpg)

**Step 2.04** We attach the two vertical beams and mount the two horizontal beams.
![Step2.04](screen/step2.04.jpg)

**Step 2.05** This is the sub assembly that will fix the paperboard at the top ...
![Step2.05](screen/step2.05.jpg)

**Step 2.06** ... assembled.
![Step2.06](screen/step2.06.jpg)

**Step 2.07** This is the sub assembly that will fix the paperboard at the side ...
![Step2.07](screen/step2.07.jpg)

**Step 2.08** ... assembled.
![Step2.08](screen/step2.08.jpg)

**Step 2.09** The two sub assemblies are assembled (note all the pins) ...
![Step2.09](screen/step2.09.jpg)

**Step 2.10** .. to the (right) side bar (note the 1 and 2 "gaps" at the bottom) ...
![Step2.10](screen/step2.10.jpg)

**Step 2.11** ... and we need to make a mirrored copy for the left side bar.
![Step2.11](screen/step2.11.jpg)

**Step 2.12** The two side bars are attached to the holder base (note the gaps on both sides).
![Step2.12](screen/step2.12.jpg)

### Attaching the hand rest

**Step 3.01** We begin with 4 L-beams, 6 pins and 2 long pins ...
![Step3.01](screen/step3.01.jpg)

**Step 3.02** ... and assemble that to the hand rest.
![Step3.02](screen/step3.02.jpg)

**Step 3.03** With two 7-long beams ...
![Step3.03](screen/step3.03.jpg)

**Step 3.04** ... connect the hand rest to the holder base.
![Step3.04](screen/step3.04.jpg)


### Attaching the foundation

**Step 4.01** We connect 1 L-beams and 3 long beams with 9 pins.
![Step4.01](screen/step4.01.jpg)

**Step 4.02** Add three braces ...
![Step4.02](screen/step4.02.jpg)

**Step 4.03**  ... to the foundation ...
![Step4.04](screen/step4.04.jpg)

**Step 4.04** ... and an L beam ...
![Step4.04](screen/step4.04.jpg)

**Step 4.05** ... is connected to the other end.
![Step4.05](screen/step4.05.jpg)

**Step 4.06** Three 15 long beams ...
![Step4.06](screen/step4.06.jpg)

**Step 4.07** ... finish off the other side of the foundation.
![Step4.07](screen/step4.07.jpg)


### Attaching the camera holder

**Step 5.01** We create two mirrored brackets ...
![Step5.01](screen/step5.01.jpg)

**Step 5.02** ... for the camera ...
![Step5.02](screen/step5.02.jpg)

**Step 5.03** ... and attach that to the foundation ...
![Step5.03](screen/step5.03.jpg)

**Step 5.04** ... closing off with the last bracket.
![Step5.04](screen/step5.04.jpg)

**Step 5.05** The screen fixture is completed.
![Step5.05](screen/step5.05.jpg)


### Attaching the screen

It is suggested to take a thin piece of paperboard and cut it to the correct dimensions: 18 lego unit high or 144 mm and 27 lego units wide or 216 mm. It is suggested to make the paperboard a couple of mm's wider than 216.

**Step 6.01** Slide in the paperboard. Make sure the long tile at the bottom presses the paperboard against the screen holder.
![Step6.01](screen/step6.01.jpg)

**Step 6.02** The "side wings" should hold the paperboard on the sides: the paperboard should be behind the flange of the round stud. Note that the "side wings" can rotate slightly to press against the paperboard.
![Step6.02](screen/step6.02.jpg)

**Step 6.03** The gray pegs at the top have a slit. The paperboard is supposed to run through those slits. Note that the peg position can be fine tuned in Y and Z direction using the axles.
![Step6.03](screen/step6.03.jpg)

**Step 6.04** This finishes the screen fixture.
